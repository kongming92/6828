Question 1
We want individual handlers so that we can push the individual exception number onto the stack. In trap.c, we need to map the idt entries to functions, and each function needs to be unique so that we can push the correct exception number in the call to the handler functions.

Question 2:
I didn't have to do anything to make the program behave correctly. The code in user space tries to generate int $14, but code in user space isn't allowed to generate interrupts 0 to 31. Thus, when the user tries to do int $14, the actual interrupt will be 13, which is the general protection fault. We only want the processor to be able to generate page faults (when a real page fault happens) and don't want to let the user program generate them whenever it wants. Otherwise the user program could run code that potentially manipulates pages that we don't want them to be able to.
